        <h5 class="win1b">JANUARY 2022 / TWO WEEKS PROJECT</h5> 
         <p class="win1c">
            <br>
            Brain is the third project that was completed as a team with Hortense and Driss, where we explored Chrome extensions.
            <br><br>
            We wanted to start with an opening tab that would bring together several culture-based APIs, such as the MET, 
            historical facts in photos, the IMDb's best movie ranking, and a historical figure of the day.
            <br><br>
            We then decided to add a feature where users could save these informations to their favorites using the "plus"
             icon on the thumbnails and access more details about them.
            <br><br>
            Finally, we thought it would be interesting to add a pop-up to-do list so users could keep track of their learning desires.

        <h1 class="win1a"><em>02.</em> THE INTERGALACTIC AGENCY</h1>
        <h5 class="win1b">NOVEMBER 2022 / TWO WEEKS PROJECT</h5>
        <p class="win1c"><br>This project was the second one as a team, with Hélène, Joanne and Angela. <br>
        <br>
        We worked with APIs and decided to create a fake intergalactic travel agency whose function would be to offer you trips on the TRAPPIST SYSTEM. <br><br>
        The idea was to retrieve certain data about all the planets in the system; their names, their orbital periods and their temperatures, 
        in order to be able to offer you the possibility of selecting a destination based on this data.
