        <p class="win1c"><br>Hey 🖖🏼
            <br><br>
            that’s it. 
            I dropped the mic on my website skeleton development this weekend. 
            <br><br>
            Well, for now, as I wanted it as minimalist as possible.
            <br><br>
            This is my very first website, the first time that I am truly diving into CSS creating my own design, discovering Media Queries, working towards making this little dude responsive.
            <br><br>
            Again, it’s not flawless, no doubt about it, but I am optimistic that in my learning journey, this will serve as a foundation for something greater, surpassing the ton of white hair you can see appearing when trying to fix css.

        <p class="win1c"><br>Hey 🖖🏼
            <br><br>
            Worked on a little idea called “The Photo Project”, which aims to help you discover your next journey by selecting stunning photographs. 📸
            <br><br>
            It's a really interesting exercise to see that starting with a simple project idea, things quickly become very complicated for a beginner like me.
            <br><br>
            But I'm making progress on this project step by step, feature by feature, and mainly learning that one resolved feature leads to a new one.
            <br><br>
            I think that's the whole story and challenge of being a developer.
            <br><br>
            Fun 🖖🏼</p><br>

            <br><br>
            I recently worked on a new opening for the Trappist System website using Spoutnik1 as a cursor and now
            I am planning to build a new website featuring an animated planetary system using JavaScript.

            <br><br>
            Worked saturday on a new version of my own website, there’s still a lot to do but it was quite fun to work on it.
