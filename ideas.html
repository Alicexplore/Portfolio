        <p class="win1c">Hey 🖖🏼
            <br><br>
            Worked on a little idea called “The Photo Project”, which aims to help you discover your next journey by selecting stunning photographs. 📸
            <br><br>
            It's a really interesting exercise to see that starting with a simple project idea, things quickly become very complicated for a beginner like me.
            <br><br>
            But I'm making progress on this project step by step, feature by feature, and mainly learning that one resolved feature leads to a new one.
            <br><br>
            I think that's the whole story and challenge of being a developer.
            <br><br>
            Fun 🖖🏼</p>

            I recently worked on a new opening for the Trappist System website using Spoutnik1 as a cursor and now
            I am planning to build a new website featuring an animated planetary system using JavaScript.🚀

            <br><br>
            Worked saturday on a new version of my own website, there’s still a lot to do but it was quite fun to work on it.
