             I love aesthetic and I love complexity.
             <br>
             I love them both and even more when they merge.
             <br><br>
             I love aesthetic because of the demands it poses and the ever-changing and surprise-filled nature of it. Through it, I am able to explore, be amazed, grow my own perspective and then connect with others.
             <br><br>
             Complexity, on the other hand, has always been a source of security, efficiency and uniqueness for me. It reminds me that there is always more to be done and new things to learn and discover, providing a sense of reassurance and an infinite loop of opportunities.
             <br><br>
             Ever since I can remember, boredom has been a constant enemy, which is why Software Development, as a field, resonates so strongly with me. It offers an exciting and endlessly stimulating solution to this adversary.
             <br><br>
             I am currently learning Software Development @AdaTechSchool <br> {since oct.22} in Paris && I absolutely love it.
             <br><br>
             I am seeking an apprenticeship as a full-stack or front-end developer for one year starting before July 2023.
             <br><br>
             In addition to software development, I am also passionate about cosmology, movies from the 80s and 90s, and definitely unbeatable on musical blind tests. 
             <br><br>
             Paris is where I am 📍
