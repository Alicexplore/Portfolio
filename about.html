             I love aesthetic and I love complexity.
             <br>
             I love them both and even more when they merge.
             <br><br>
             Aesthetic appeals to me because of its constantly changing and surprising nature, allowing me to explore,
             appreciate, and propose new ideas while also impacting others. 
             <br><br>
             Complexity, on the other hand, provides a sense of security and efficiency, as it reminds me that there is always more to learn and discover. 
             <br><br>
             As far as I can remember, boredom has always been my worst enemy, which is why it was more than obvious that Software Development would respond 
             almost instinctively to everything that had been missing until now; the biggest and most exciting solution to boredom.
             <br><br>
             I am currently learning Software Development @AdaTechSchool <br> {since oct.22} in Paris && I absolutely love it.
             <br><br>
             I am seeking an apprenticeship as a full-stack or front-end developer for one year starting before July 2023.
             <br><br>
             In addition to software development, I am also passionate about cosmology, movies from the 80s and 90s, and definitely unbeatable on musical blind tests. 
             <br><br>
             Paris is where I am üìç
