        <p>
            I love aesthetic and I love complexity. <br>
            I love them both and even more when they merge. <br><br>
            I love aesthetic because I like its demands and the fact that it is multiple, changing and always surprising. 
            So I can travel, marvel, change too, improve my eye on things, propose new aesthetics and then touch people.
            All this sometimes without moving. <br><br>

            Complexity was my first acolyte, it always made me feel safe, efficient, unique, it may seems paradoxical but it‚Äôs not.
            It tells me that everything remains to be done and that there are new things to learn, new problems to solve, again and again.
            That is why it's so reassuring, a kind of infinite loop of windows that open on my needs.<br><br>

            And this because, as far as I can remember, boredom has always been my worst enemy, which is why it was more than obvious that
            Software Development would respond almost instinctively to everything that had been missing until now; the biggest and most exciting solution to boredom.<br><br>

            ‚û§ I am currently learning Software Development @AdaTechSchool {since oct.22} in Paris && I absolutely love it.<br><br>

            ‚û§ I am looking for an apprenticeship as a full-stack or front-end developer for one year to start before July 2023, <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alicebergonhe/">let‚Äôs meet up ! üëãüèº</a><br><br>

            ‚û§ I'm also passionate about cosmology, movies from the 80s, 90s, and definitely unbeatable on musical blind tests.<br><br>

            ‚û§ Paris is where I am üìç<br> <br>
